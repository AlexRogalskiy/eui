// Helper file for supplying EUI Amsterdam globals (invisibles only)
// Must be imported AFTER a colors modifier file

// Functions need to be first, since we use them in our variables and mixin definitions
@import '../eui-amsterdam/global_styling/functions/index';

// Variables come next, and are used in some mixins
@import 'global_styling/variables/index';

// Mixins provide generic code expansion through helpers
@import '../eui-amsterdam/global_styling/mixins/index';
